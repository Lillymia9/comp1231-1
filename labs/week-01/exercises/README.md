# Exercise for this week

1. Create an index.html file
2. Embed JS in the head of the document using the script tag without a src attribute
3. Inside the script tag `console.log` something out
4. Create a file called index.js
5. Import it using a script tag with a src attribute. Inside the JavaScript file, include `console.log('it works!')`

Don't worry about uploading your solution to GitHub, the intent of this exercise is to only familiarize yourself with how JavaScript can be embedded or imported into an HTML document.

Please reference the [example](../examples) folder and look at both the index.html and the index.js for reference.
