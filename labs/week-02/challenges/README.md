# Week 02 - Introduction to working with JS
## Embedding JavaScript

> There are a number of ways JS can be introduced into an HTML document. For the purpose of this exercise, we're going to look at a few different ways to complete the process. Sometimes JS should be in the head of an HTML document, and sometimes it should be at the bottom of the documents body. This all depends on if the JS imported is blocking the browser's UI thread which will delay content rendering on our page. How do we know if our JS does that?

# COMP1231 - Exercise Week 02

1. Create an HTML document in your week-02 folder 
2. Create a JS file called index.js
3. Import index.js into your HTML document
4. Inside the index.js 
  - `console.log('it works!')`
5. Declare 3 variables
   - 1 var variable with a value (number, string, object, function, boolean)
   - 1 let variable with a value
   - 1 const variable with a value
6. `console.log(var1, var2, var2)`

:squirrel: `The name doesn't have to be var1, var2 and var3`  Use descriptive names. If you create a variable to hold a phone number, hold a string or set of numbers containing your phone

```javascript
const phone = '1-647-661-0808' // string data type
const mobile = 41688822192 // number data type
```
